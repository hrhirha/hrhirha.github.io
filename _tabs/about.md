My name is Hamza, I am pationate about cyber security, I have some experience as a Penetration Tester while working at [Stryve](https://stryvesecure.com/), one of the leading cybersecurity providers in Ireland.

I have worked with different programming languages such as C, C++ and Python.

I have some hands on experience in backend development using NestJS.

I try to develop my skills further by working on platfoms like Hack The Box and PentesterLab, and I post my writeups here.
